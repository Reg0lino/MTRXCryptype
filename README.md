## > PROTOCOL: Signal Acquisition

1.  `VISUAL_AMPLIFICATION REQUIRED` :: Engage [F11] for optimal field analysis.
2.  `INITIATE_CONNECTION` :: Establish link via designated PC access point.
3.  `DATA_STREAM_ACTIVE` :: Monitor fluctuations. Observe anomalies.
4.  `ISOLATE_PACKETS [GREEN/YELLOW]` :: Use cursor-driven amplification [MOUSE].
5.  `DECRYPTION_CHALLENGE` :: Input sequence required [KEYBOARD]. Timing is critical.
6.  `MONITOR_CORE_METRICS [CPU/MEM/BIO]` :: System stability is... variable. Thresholds exist. Consequences are real.
