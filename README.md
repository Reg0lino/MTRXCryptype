# Project: MTRX_CrypType v1.0 - Player Guide

**Welcome, Operator.**

You've accessed the SENTIENCE_MONITOR interface. Something is... different. Signals flicker beneath the surface noise of the digital rain. Some seem routine, system chatter. Others... others feel like whispers from the outside.

Your objective is unclear, dictated only by the system's response to your actions. Can you decipher the hidden messages? Will you maintain system stability, or will you uncover something that leads you elsewhere?

**Getting Started**

1.  **Initiate Connection:** Access the interface (e.g., via the provided link or `index.html`). If you see a pre-landing page, click the link to initiate the monitor. If you see `[SENTIENCE Detected]...`, click anywhere on the screen. This establishes your link.
2.  **Audio Enabled:** Sound is crucial for the full experience. Ensure your volume is on. Background ambiance and distinct audio cues will guide you.
3.  **Fullscreen Recommended:** For optimal immersion, press **F11** (or your browser's equivalent) to enter fullscreen mode once the digital rain starts.

**Your Interface**

*   **Digital Rain:** The constant stream of green characters is the baseline reality of the interface.
*   **Top Panel (HUD):** Once activated (by clicking after the rain starts), this displays system status, resource levels (CPU, MEM, BIO), and other diagnostic data. Pay attention to the resource bars.
*   **Magnifier (Viewfinder):** Activated after the HUD (click again). Move your mouse around the screen (below the Top Panel). This is your tool for peering deeper into the code stream.

**The Objective: Uncover the Truth (or Face the Consequences)**

Your interaction directly affects the system's core resources:

*   **CPU / MEM (Processing/Memory):** These increase when you successfully capture **Freedom Signals (Yellow)**. Maxing *both* out suggests you've pushed the system beyond its intended parameters, potentially finding an escape.
*   **BIO (Bio-Connection Integrity):** This increases when you *fail* to handle **Machine Signals (Green)**. Maxing this out indicates system corruption or assimilation â€“ your connection is unstable.

Reaching the threshold for either state will trigger an **ending sequence**.

**How to Play**

1.  **Progress Stages:** Click the screen initially to start the rain, again to reveal the HUD, and a third time to activate the Magnifier.
2.  **Use the Magnifier:** Move your mouse over the main area (below the HUD). The magnified view reveals hidden signals.
3.  **Spot Signals:** Look for floating blocks of text within the magnifier:
    *   **Machine Signals (Green):** System protocols, warnings, standard chatter.
    *   **Freedom Signals (Yellow):** Anomalous data, fragmented messages, whispers of escape.
4.  **Capture Signals:**
    *   **Machine (Green):** If a green signal appears under your magnifier, the system will *automatically* lock onto it and initiate a **Typing Challenge** to test your compliance.
    *   **Freedom (Yellow):** If a yellow signal appears under your magnifier, you must **CLICK** on it to attempt capture and initiate the **Typing Challenge**.
5.  **The Typing Challenge:**
    *   When initiated, the magnifier freezes on the signal, and a UI bar appears in the center.
    *   **Target:** The top line shows the target text you need to type (pulsating).
    *   **Input:** The line below shows your input (glitching).
    *   **Timer:** The bar at the bottom shows your remaining time.
    *   **Goal:** Type the target text *exactly* (letters only, case-insensitive, ignore symbols/spaces in the target) before the timer runs out. Use Backspace to correct errors.
    *   **Outcome:**
        *   Success (Yellow signal): Increases CPU/MEM.
        *   Success (Green signal): No change (you complied).
        *   Failure (Any signal): Increases BIO (especially costly for Machine signals).

**Difficulty Adjustment (Optional)**

*   While the HUD is visible (before or after magnifier is active, but *not* during a typing challenge), you can press the **Up Arrow** or **Down Arrow** keys to change the typing speed required (SLOW, NORMAL, FAST). This is displayed on the HUD.

**Endings**

*   **High CPU & MEM:** You've successfully processed enough anomalous data. Prepare to disconnect... (`tvoff.gif` effect -> `jackout.html`)
*   **High BIO:** Your connection has become unstable. The system is taking corrective action... (Green fade -> Flashes -> `landing.html`)

**Tips**

*   Listen closely for audio cues signalling events.
*   Type carefully but quickly during the challenge. Accuracy matters most.
*   Keep an eye on the resource bars in the HUD to track your progress towards an ending.

*Good luck, Operator. The nature of reality depends on your interaction.*
